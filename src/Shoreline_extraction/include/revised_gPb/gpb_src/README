*** Instructions for building global Pb from source code. ***

Next, follow steps A, B, and C below.

-- STEP A --
To build the mex files from (2) (this package):

(i)   Edit Rules.make

      Edit the following line in Rules.make to point to the directory where matlab 
      is installed (example given below):

      MATLAB_PATH := /usr/sww/pkg/matlab-r2013a

      Also, if you are using a 32-bit instead of a 64-bit architecture, uncomment
      the lines specifying 32-bit architecture and comment the lines specifying
      64-bit:

      # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (32-bit machines)
      MATLAB_ARCH := glnx86
      MEX_EXTN := mexglx

      # matlab mex file compilation settings - matlab architecture (64-bit machines)
      #MATLAB_ARCH := glnxa64
      #MEX_EXTN := mexa64

(ii)  Type the following make commands:

      make
      make matlab

(iii) The mex files needed for globalPb can be found in the matlab/segmentation/
      subdirectory.  Copy these .mexa64 (or .mexglx for 32-bit) files into the 
      lib/ subdirectory of package (1), replacing the precompiled mex files.

-- STEP B --
To build the segment program from (3):

(i)   Follow the instructions included in (3) for compiling from source.

(ii)  Copy the "segment" executable into the lib/ subdirectory of (1), 
      replacing the precompiled "segment" executable.

-- STEP C --
You should now be able to run the example.m file in (1), which computes global Pb
on an example image.
