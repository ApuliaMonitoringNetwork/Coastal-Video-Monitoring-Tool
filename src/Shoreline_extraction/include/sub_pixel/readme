This is the Matlab source code of the sub pixel edge detection method detailed in the paper “Accurate Subpixel Edge Location Based on Partial Area Effect”, published by Elsevier in 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885612001850 
The main folder contains the following files: 
- subpixelEdges is the detection method. Type 'help subpixelEdges' for more info 
- visEdges is the method for displaying detected edges over the image 
- subpixelImage creates a high resolution binary image with the detected edges 
- subsetEdges extracts a subset of edges that fulfill condition 
- example1 is an example of using the method with a synthetic image 
- example2 is similar but using a real image 
- example3 uses a big image of a printed text captured by a mobile phone camera 
- example4 creates a high resolution binary image for the example 1 
- example5 is an example of using the method with a high-noise synthetic image 
- example6 is similar but using a real angiography 
- subpixelStartGUI is a graphical app to test different features of the method
